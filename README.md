# Westlawn Homepage

This is the new Westlawn Homepage designed to link our current services and provide a visual update for the school's online presence. 

To get started, first for the repository using the **Fork** button on the upper-right of the screen.

You will need to install jekyll to run a development server.
```

You can run the app using the `jekyll` static site builder:

```
$ jekyll serve
```

At that point, the app will be running on [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
