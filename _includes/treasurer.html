      David has covered over 85000 miles on powerboats, and another 85000 miles under sail. He was raised in a large family with a private marina filled with up to a dozen different types of boats at a time: power, sail, racing, cruising, inshore, offshore. He has crossed the Pacific four times, Atlantic twice, two seasons in the Caribbean, and several seasons throughout Europe. His racing skills were honed by nearly daily races with or against his brother, Randy Smyth. From winning the Maxi class in Transpac to winning the Libera Classe A Deutsche Cup, his yacht race record is extensive and international. David developed what is now called DSS during his studies at Westlawn during middle school, using a 5o5 with C-Class foils oriented horizontally.

			Computer science has been a big part of David’s professional life: David learned to code at age 14 while working on hand built pre-production versions of the world’s first microprocessor, where David wrote the transcendental math libraries for the SR-71 autopilot; during High School he worked on missile and aircraft flight control systems; while a sophomore at University David delivered to NASA the redundancy management, fault detection, and abort control software for the Space Shuttle; David’s university research included developing software fault tolerance system for the B-1B bomber, the F-35 initial design, and for fighter aircraft developed by Israel and Taiwan; R&D in research centers for major international corporations included robotics, user interfaces, software architectures, and distributed systems; David was the Software Architect on all the Mars Rover missions.

			David can often be found aboard his modified Olson 40, designed by Westlawn alumnus George Olson. David has performed a bare hull refit on the boat, and has converted her to and all-electric yacht including electric propulsion, as well as innovative rigging layouts to enable safer, faster, and easier sailing by a retirement aged sailor.

			Westlawn is now the focus of David’s energies, as he works to give opportunities to the next generations.
