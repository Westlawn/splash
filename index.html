    <h1 class="callout-title">Practical, Project Based Learning</h1>
    <div class="callout-copy">
      <p>
        Our courses are online, and have always been based on “Project Based Learning” which is widely recognized as the most effective way to learn: As a Westlawn student you will learn knowledge and skills, and immediately apply your skills on practical yacht designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project Based Learning enables you to internalize and retain the knowledge and skills, as you use the tools and processes used in professional yacht design firms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Select Westlawn students also have the opportunity to collaborate on Superyacht designs at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena California. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By the time you graduate, your portfolio of professional quality design work will include nine designs of yachts engineered in aluminum, fiberglass, and wood, both sail and power.
      </p>
      <p>
        This realistic and practical education means you will have the confident ability to design yachts for clients upon graduation.

    <div class="callout-copy">
      <p>
        Since 1930, Westlawn has set the standard for yacht design education. Over the years, our alumni continue to lead the marine industry in setting the tone for style throughout the industry, including sailing and power yachts and commercial vessels.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, alumnus Jack Hargrave gave us the now pervasive style of sport fishing boats with long fordecks and wide and low cockpits.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Alumni Tom Fexas, Bruce King, Gerry Douglas, Roger Martin, Dudley Dix, John Swarbrick, Doug Zurn, Rod Johnstone, and many others have designed large numbers of beautiful and influencial custom and production yachts including many America’s Cup racers.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Eos, the 320’ three masted schooner built by Lurssen, was designed by Westlawn graduate and Senior Partner of Langan Design, Antonio Ferrer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent graduates include Adam Voorhees, Superyacht design award winner, and Adriana Monk, a Chief Designer for Wally Yachts of Monaco.
