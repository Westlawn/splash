        <h4>President</h4>
        <p>
          Although he may be most known for heading the flight software of nearly every mission to the surface of Mars, David has always had a love for boats and the sea. A Westlawn alum himself, David felt a call of duty taking over the management of Westlawn, and is endlessly excited to be involved with the school. He is constantly talking with boatbuilders and attending boat shows in search of jobs for Westlawn students and alumni, and as Westlawn's newest President he has already spearheaded enormous changes to help enable the school to properly move into the 21st century.

        <h4>Chairman</h4>
        <p>
          Tony Lawson is at the top of the game in both yachting and business. As a teen, his first business was shipping using a Baltic Trading Schooner. This endeavor morphed into creating the Freeport in Grenada and becoming one of the largest players in international liquor distribution. By his early twenties, he was a self made millionaire, and back in the UK founded a property development empire that has included residential and commercial properties literally around the world, and includes shipyards and superyacht marinas. His yachting background includes winning the Lord Nelson Trophy at 1974 Antigua Sailing Week aboard his own Swan 44, winning Transpac with David Smyth, a range of cruising and racing sail and power yachts, his Team Concise with several Class 40 and an amazing Mod 70, winning the Class 40 World Championships, winning Fastnet, and even winning Seahorse International Sailing Sailor of the Month Hall of Fame. Tony is perhaps best known among his friends as the person who gives opportunities to others.
